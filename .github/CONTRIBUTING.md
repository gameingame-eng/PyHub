## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please search the [existing issues](github.com) to see if the problem has already been reported. When filing a bug, please include:
* A clear, descriptive title.
* Specific steps to reproduce the issue.
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* Your Python version and OS (e.g., Windows 11, macOS 14).

### Pull Requests
1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines.
3. **Add tests** for any new functionality to ensure quality.
4. Update the `README.md` if you change any user-facing features.
5. Submit your PR with a detailed description of your changes.

## Style Guidelines
* **Python Style**: Follow [PEP 8](peps.python.org) standards.
* **Docstrings**: Use [Google-style docstrings](google.github.io) for all new modules and functions.
* **Commits**: Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., `feat: add login functionality`).
